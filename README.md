# Test Repository
This is a test repository for setting projects.
The key test elements are
- Set up a project to develop a static library.
- Set up a repository setting such as authority of members, and pull requests.


# How to Test?
First of all, please install Visual Studio on your desktop. You can install Visual Studio at [this link](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/ko/vs/community/).
Note that you have to check `Desktop development with C++` (`C++를 사용한 데스크톱 개발`) when you select what workload you want to install.

And, unless you are familiar with GitHub, I recommend you install `GitHub Desktop` which is a GUI application of GitHub for Windows. You can install GitHub Desktop at [this link](https://docs.github.com/ko/desktop/installing-and-authenticating-to-github-desktop/installing-github-desktop).
If you are not familiar with GitHub Desktop, see [this recommended link](https://velog.io/@wns450/Github-Desktop-%EC%82%AC%EC%9A%A9%EB%B2%95)(Korean) to install this repository on your computer.

> [!CAUTION]  
> Please do NOTHING before following the guidelines below.
> And, NEVER change anything about the settings of projects or solutions.
> Furthermore, please do NOT change the existing files.
> If you want your own test, I recommend adding a source file to the `Test Console` project.
> You can use `Test Consol.cpp` but it is only for public tests. If you update `Test Console.cpp`, it is okay.
> If you want to add codes to the library, you can add header and source files to the `TOC_Star_Project` project. You can test your own source file only in this way.

> [!WARNING]
> We use [CGAL](https://www.cgal.org/index.html) including [Boost Graph Library (BGL)](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_75_0/libs/graph/doc/index.html) for implementation of graph algorithms and computational geometric algorithms.
> Thus, if you don't know about those libraries, refer [this link](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_86_0/libs/graph/doc/table_of_contents.html) for BGL and [this link](https://doc.cgal.org/latest/Manual/general_intro.html) for CGAL.
> Additionally, CGAL extends the BGL by introducing concepts such as HalfedgeGraph and Face Graph. You can see more details at [this link](https://doc.cgal.org/latest/BGL/index.html).

(1) First, clone this repository on your working directory, i.e., anywhere on your computer where you want to work.
If you didn't set the directory where this repository is installed, then the default position may be `C:\Users\USER\Documents\GitHub` (`내 PC\문서\GitHub`).

>[!Warning]
>Notice that if you are not a manager then you have to fork this repository.

(2) Open the solution file named `TOC_Star_Project.sln` in the main directory.

---

(3) After that, you may see the Visual Studio project, as shown in the screenshot below.

After that, you can see the change that `Test Console` becomes bold and `TOC_Star_Project` becomes not bold in Solution Explorer.
